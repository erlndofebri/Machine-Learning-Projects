# Machine Learning Projects
This repository consist of 6 projects of different types of Machine Learning program (Regression and Classification Problem) including supervised learning and unsupervised learning

#### DB Scan Unsupervised Learning
The goal of this project is to know when we should using DB Scan and when we should we use other clustering model. We built clustering using different types of unsupervised learning model and we compared the result with DB Scan model

#### Decision Tree
The goal of this project is to learn how the decision tree works on multiclassification problem and visualize how decision tree. We built multiclassification model using Decision Tree to predict which species of penguins belongs to.

#### Ensemble Method
The goal of this project is to predict whether the telco customer will be churned or not. We used several ensemble methods and tried to compare each model

#### KNN
The goal of this project is to predict sonar information belongs to. We used KNN model as model prediction

#### Regression Case
We use several models to predict rock density and tried to compared the result of those model

#### SVC
The goal of this project is to predict quality of wine quality using SVC
